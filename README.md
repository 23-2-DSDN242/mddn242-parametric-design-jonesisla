## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

Each of my letters is composed of arcs and rectangles. I use multiple different arcs in each letter to form different shapes, I also have arcs I am using as "cut outs" they go overtop of other arcs to get more of the shape that I like. I also have rectangles in most of my letters which help to define letters like l,i,h,b,etc. 

I spent a lot of time getting my alphabet right, I didn't like a lot of the letters and I ended up adding lots more arcs so that I was able to get the desired shape I wanted my letters to take. Originally I wanted all of my letters to fit within the main circle, but I realised this was a lot harder than I thought as it meant I was making shapes really small, which in turn was very hard to read. I also encountered a few problems with all of my letters being cohesive, as some were big and some were small. I ended up fixing all of this and I am happy with the outcome.

The five parameters per arc:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `start` : the start of the circle arc
  * `stop` : the stop of the circle arc

  The four parameters per rectangle:
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the rectangle
  * `offsety` : y offset of the rectangle
  * `offsetw` : width offset of the rectangle
  * `offseth` : height offset of the rectangle
